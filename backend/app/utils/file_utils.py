File Utility Operations for Document Verification System

This module provides a utility class for file-related operations, including saving uploaded files,
deleting files, and extracting file extensions. It integrates with FastAPI's UploadFile and the
application's settings for consistent file handling.

Usage:
- Instantiate: `file_utils = FileUtils()`
- Save a file: `file_path = file_utils.save_upload_file(upload_file)`
- Delete a file: `success = file_utils.delete_file(file_path)`
- Get extension: `ext = file_utils.get_file_extension(filename)`
